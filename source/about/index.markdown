Scott graduated from Kansas State University in 2010 and has worked at [Softek Solutions, Inc][softek] in Prairie Village, KS ever since. At Softek, Scott is regarded as a talented and multi-faceted team member. He has experience with many aspects of software development from server side to client facing. He's always interested in learning and seeking out knowledge on how new technologies can be applied to his interests in analytics, data visualization, and search. Other than software, Scott enjoys reading, cycling, running, and spending time with his wife. He really enjoys living in Kansas City, but Scott and his wife Christie make sure to travel to Colorado at least once a year to climb 14ers or other outdoorsy things.
